🚀 Pac-Man Recreated in Unity! 🎮

I recently built a Pac-Man-style game using Unity as part of my game development journey! 🕹️

🔹 Features:
✅ Classic Pac-Man mechanics – eat pellets, avoid ghosts, and collect power-ups!
✅ Multiple levels with increasing difficulty.
✅ AI-powered ghost movement and pathfinding for a challenging experience.
✅ Smooth animations and retro-inspired UI.

🔹 Tech Stack:
🎮 Engine: Unity
💻 Programming Language: C#
🎨 Assets: Custom & Free Sprites
🧠 AI: Ghost pathfinding logic

Building this game helped me enhance my skills in game mechanics, AI pathfinding, and level design. I also worked on improving game balancing to keep it fun and engaging!
