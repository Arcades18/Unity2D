# Unity2D
A curated collection of my 2-dimensional Unity gamesâ€”built with C#, love for pixel-art, and the relentless urge to iterate, experiment, and learn.

Welcome to **Unity-2D-Projects**, the home for every 2-D game I create while mastering Unityâ€™s 2-D tool-set. Each folder is a self-contained project that you can open, study, tweak, and extend.

| Folder | Genre / Theme | Status |
| ------ | ------------- | ------ |
| `Bomberman-Clone` | Grid-based arcade action | Complete |
| `PacMan-Clone` | Maze chase with AI ghosts | Complete |
